# GEEC
Matlab-based program to calculate gravity and gravity gradients due to irregularly shaped bodies

GEEC, stands for Gal Eötvös Earth Calculator, is an open-source software dedicated to compute precisely the gravitational fields of a mass body. This software is using the MATLAB language. It is designed to be easily used and accessible for users with no prior knowledge of MATLABTM programming language.
